                    <h3>2023-2025: CEO & Co-Founder, Zealot (Acquired by UserEvidence)</h3>
                    <p>In 2022, while a junior at Butler University making my schedule for senior year, I noticed I only had 3 credit hours left to graduate. As much as I was excited for a blow-off senior year, I had a thought: what if I started a business and somehow got Butler to let me use the business as those 3 credits?</p>
                    <p>But Butler didn't allow that at the time.</p>
                    
                    <p>So I started cold emailing every professor at the business school, pitching them on why they should let me boycott their class and build a company instead. After a few weeks, only one guy responded.</p>
                    
                    <p>But that's all we needed. I was in. After hours of exchanging stories and visions for entrepreneurship at Butler, I got him to sponsor it. We speedran a non-existent process that was allegedly supposed to take 8 weeks in 24 hours.</p>
                    
                    <p>This taught me one of my favorite life secrets: the "rules" aren't always real. Most people think the world is set in stone, but it's way more bendable than it looks if you just push :)</p>
                    
                    <p>Now that I had my credits secured, I needed to pick what to build...</p>
                    
                    <p>During my time at Boldvoice, one of my key projects was leveraging happy customers as advocates to drive growth more efficiently. Through this, I noticed a major shift in how people buy: traditional channels like paid ads, SEO, and cold outreach weren't as effective as they once were.</p>
                    
                    <p>Consumers no longer trust what companies say about themselves, especially with the constant bombardment of ads and spam. Instead, they trust people they know or real customers of the company.</p>
                    
                    <p>This insight became the foundation for my thesis: if you can properly motivate and organize your customers, they'll outperform your own team in sales, marketing &amp; product feedback.</p>
                    
                    <p>Yet, no one had built the infrastructure to make this happen at scale.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'd quickly connected &amp; met with Srikar Chava &amp; Brandon Jakobson who both shared a similar vision for a creator-led GTM. And Zealot was born.</p>
                    
                    <p>I remember one day I left class for 30 minutes to take a demo call with a brand called No Cow. All we had was a Figma prototype and at the end of the call they asked how much it was.</p>
                    
                    <p>We'd yet to come up with a price so I randomly charged a number I thought there'd be no chance in hell they would pay.</p>
                    
                    <p>"It'll be $500/mo"</p>
                    
                    <p>"Oh that's it, sweet! We were paying like $4k/mo for our current platform and Zealot is way way better so that's great--send over the link to pay."</p>
                    
                    <p>SHIT! But whatever, we had our first real paying customer.</p>
                    
                    <p>After graduating, I kept working on Zealot even during my real day job at JPMorgan. I often had to sneak down to the lower levels of the office building to take demo calls because I had no other time and wanted this to work.</p>
                    
                    <p>Initially, we were selling a Shopify app to consumer brands. It was going well, and we'd signed on pretty well-known brands like Jack Links, Victrola, Golden Hippo, No Cow, etc. but at the same time... we'd also begun using our own advocates as a B2B growth lever to sell to other consumer brands and it was working so well.</p>
                    
                    <p>And while it may seem obvious now, no one was really doing this yet in B2B... but our intuition kept pointing us to a world where we knew this infrastructure to activate advocates at scale has to exist.</p>
                    
                    <p>And the impact of one advocate could be even greater in B2B since it's not just a pair of jeans but often times several 6 or 7 figure purchases--so much more important to get peer validation.</p>
                    
                    <p>So overnight, we took the risk to pivot our entire business to B2B &amp; cut loose our existing customers.</p>
                    
                    <p>We knew we needed more money to begin putting together an eng team and GTM function so we began fundraising for a small round.</p>
                    
                    <p>And ended up closing our first round of funding which was led by Ripple Ventures in Spring 2024. They quickly doubled down again a few months later as we began to grow the B2B product offering.</p>
                    
                    <p>Not having much experience in the space, I think we ended up completing over 300+ customer chats to learn more about what they were all trying to get done.</p>
                    
                    <p>Eventually, we ended up signing our first REAL enterprise customer who was ClickUp, for $30k/yr. That was cool because our highest contract before was only $3k/yr--a 10x jump. Even funnier looking back now, only about 1.5 years later, as we signed our first million-dollar deal with a Fortune 50 and count customers like Cisco, Rippling, Microsoft, Salesforce, Airtable, Dassault Systems, Carta, &amp; more today.</p>
                    
                    <p>As we kept growing, we knew we now needed even more capital to hire a team and build a proper enterprise GTM motion. Because we were still young 20 year olds selling to massive enterprises who almost never took us seriously.</p>
                    
                    <p>Everything changed when we were approached about a potential M&amp;A process with a few inbound buyers in our space. We explored these options and realized we could shortcut building a mature enterprise B2B engine by joining forces, and so we did. We took Zealot from a $45 83(b) election investment to each of us becoming millionaires in our early 20s, which still feels crazy to say.</p>
                    
                    <p>As CEO, I wore every hat--design, PM, outbound, AE, CS, product marketing. Even though I still don't really know how to do any of those jobs the right way. I like to joke that I'm T-shaped till the day I die.</p>
                    
                    <p>And the aftermath of the Butler story is also cool because now there's a legit entrepreneurship program at Butler with 100+ businesses started as a result. Pretty cool!</p>

                    <h3>2025: Run a marathon (failed)</h3>
                    <p>Mile 22 out of 26. I passed out.</p>
                    <p>Next thing I knew I was waking up to the medics restarting my heart on the way to the ER. Out of the corner of my eye I saw my fiancé trying to get in, but they wouldn't let her. Later found out she rode up front.</p>
                    <p>All I remember in that ambulance was asking the medics if I was going to die. They just wouldn't answer me. So I kept getting more and more scared.</p>
                    <p>I kept thinking this was it. My life was over. I thought about all the things I still wanted to do.</p>
                    <p>Then I got to the hospital and don't remember anything else.</p>
                    <p>Later found out I got a rare disease called rhabdomyolysis. They took my CK levels in the ER. Normal level is like 500... mine was 50K+. I was in the hospital for almost a week on IV flush. (Hospital food is surprisingly good haha)</p>
                    <p>The doctor said I was lucky I came in and got found so fast or I would have been dead. Apparently happens in 1 out of 10 cases. It hits and gets serious FAST!</p>
                    <p>But yeah honestly kind of learned from this that you never know what will happen when you stare death in the eyes.</p>

                    <h3>Strong Beliefs, Loosely Held :)</h3>
                    <p>• Success is being excited to go to work and being excited to come home.</p>
                    <p>• What product has a better moat than the QWERTY keyboard...</p>
                    <p>• Every action humans take can be traced back to an incentive.</p>
                    <p>• Figure out how to turn yourself into an API, where you give others something and they give you things in return.</p>
                    <p>• People take 1k steps per day, doom-scroll, eat like shit, and then complain about being sad or feeling shitty.</p>
                    <p>• Asking good questions is way more important than having the right answer.</p>
                    <p>• Most people just want to seem cool and unique to others. What can help them with that?</p>
                    <p>• Once you understand the incentives behind mainstream media, it becomes truly unwatchable.</p>
                    <p>• 4,000 Weeks is by far the most insane framing for how short life is.</p>
                    <p>• Your brain will find a problem to focus on. Choose your problems wisely.</p>
                    <p>• Great founders have the shortest memory and are ignorant about the past.</p>
                    <p>• Everything is negotiable besides death and taxes.</p>
                    <p>• Toilets are made wrong.</p>
                    <p>• Great performance in school is not correlated to success.</p>
                    <p>• How fun are inside jokes? Like, so funny.</p>
                    <p>• Industry lingo or buzzwords are a moat in itself, making it harder to break in or understand what's going on, which makes those ppl more valuable, especially in fucking finance. I never knew what they were saying & I doubt they did either.</p>
                    <p>• Most of the entrepreneurial or business advice you hear / read on social media is the leftovers. The good ideas & true alpha aren't getting blasted online unfortunately.</p>
                    <p>• Web3 was/is just being able to invest in private companies w/ less friction.</p>
                    <p>• Most people aren't ok with not having an answer key or external validation on what they're doing, which is why 9-5 is so popular - it's easy to measure yourself & have your life pre-decided for you.</p>
                    <p>• Wearing the same clothes every day isn't that big of a deal.</p>
                    <p>• Ppl will believe anything they see.</p>
                    <p>• Very few ppl have the power to decide what ppl see.</p>
                    <p>• Burnout is fake - it just means they want to quit or they don't like what they're doing.</p>
                    <p>• The constant stream of others' successes ("look at my life, look where I am") makes younger people feel worse by comparison & is likely one of the causes of rising anxiety / depression rates in Gen Z.</p>
                    <p>• Gen Z has a recall problem.</p>
                    <p>• Most times in life, the real strategy is simply: we're gonna figure it out. But most people judge this as a moment in time or think the decision is final.</p>
                    <p>• Most people borrow their desires from others.</p>
                    <p>• News, sports, media are mostly about mining your attention for ad revenue, and they're very good at it. Don't get too trapped in this or else you'll become the product :0</p>

                    <p>Right now, I'm working hard to simplify my health/fitness routine down to 2 things. If I do these two things most of the time, I'm typically feeling pretty good mentally & physically:</p>
                    <p>1. <strong>Morning workout</strong> - Usually swimming around 1,000 yards or lifting.</p>
                    <p>2. <strong>Eat foods from the perimeter of grocery stores</strong> - I love going out to dinner, but I try to eat real food most of the time.</p>

                    <h3>Other Things That Help</h3>

                    <p>• Annual blood panel from Function Health. I paste my results into Claude and ask what I'm deficient in, then buy supplements to fix them. Here's my current stack:</p>

                    <p>• Modern bathroom redesign - toilet is too high (bodies designed to squat), sink too low, shower is a deathtrap. We fill this room with toxic chemicals. We can't afford to do it this way</p>

        <h2>Why gamification fails (and how to fix it)</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; opacity: 0.7;">March 2025</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>The problem with most gamification:</strong> Companies use points, badges, and leaderboards to trick users into doing what the organization wants. That's backwards.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Gamification isn't about manipulating someone to complete a task. It's about using game mechanics as a motivating factor to help people reach their own goals in a more habit-forming way.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 25px;"><strong>The core principle:</strong> Gamification is about motivating people to achieve their own goals, NOT the organization's goals.</p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">The Pain Squad case study</h3>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">SickKids hospital in Toronto needed children with cancer to fill out daily pain journals. The kids were suffering. The treatments were painful. Patients weren't up to the task of filling out their pain journals, particularly on bad days. With inconsistent reporting, it was impossible for doctors to determine which treatments work best.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Previous studies had tried paying kids to fill out journals. It didn't work.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">So they looked at the problem from the kids' perspective. They created "Pain Squad," an iPhone app that enlists kids as members of a special police force on a mission to hunt down pain.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">When children complete their pain report three days in a row, they progress from rookie to sergeant and through ranks until they finally become a chief. The team recruited heroes from Canada's leading police shows to create videos encouraging the children. The actors address each child by their rank.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">According to one mother: "It makes her feel that she's a part of this."</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 25px;">Instead of paying kids to provide information that researchers need, Pain Squad engages them in an inspiring mission. Most importantly, they are contributing to something bigger than themselves.</p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">The Hook Model: Building habit-forming technology</h3>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Effective hooks transition users from relying upon external triggers to cueing mental associations with internal triggers. Users move from states of low engagement to high engagement, from low preference to high preference.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Five fundamental questions for building effective hooks:</strong></p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>1. Internal trigger:</strong> What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? Does your users' internal trigger frequently prompt them to action?</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>2. External trigger:</strong> What brings users to your service? Is your external trigger cueing them when they are most likely to act?</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>3. Action:</strong> What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier?</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>4. Variable reward:</strong> Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more? Does the reward satisfy your users' need while leaving them wanting more?</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>5. Investment:</strong> What "bit of work" do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use?</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 25px;"><strong>6. Repeat</strong> this process over and over again.</p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">The power of variable rewards</h3>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Research shows that levels of dopamine surge when the brain is expecting a reward. But here's the key: what draws us to act is not the sensation we receive from the reward itself, but the need to alleviate the craving for that reward.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don't create desire. The unsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn't drive you to keep opening it again and again.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">However, add some variability to the mix—suppose a different treat magically appears in your fridge every time you open it—and voilà, intrigue is created.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 25px;"><strong>Three types of rewards:</strong></p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Social rewards (Tribe):</strong> Driven by our connectedness with other people. Quora demonstrated that social rewards and the variable reinforcement of recognition from peers proved to be much more frequent and salient motivators than monetary rewards.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Hunt rewards:</strong> The pursuit itself. Seeking pleasure and avoiding pain.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 25px;"><strong>Self rewards:</strong> Seeking social acceptance while avoiding social rejection.</p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">Removing friction</h3>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Any technology or product that significantly reduces the steps to complete a task will enjoy high adoption rates by the people it assists.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Remove every single piece of friction in the process. No logins. Unique links for every user. Decrease time it takes to complete actions.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 25px;"><strong>The endowed progress effect:</strong> Two groups of customers were given punch cards awarding a free car wash once the cards were fully punched. One group was given a blank punch card with eight squares; the other was given a punch card with ten squares that came with two free punches. Both groups still had to purchase eight car washes to receive a free wash; however, the second group—those that were given two free punches—had a staggering 82 percent higher completion rate.</p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">Internal vs external triggers</h3>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>External triggers</strong> tell the user what to do next by placing information within the user's environment (emails, notifications, text messages).</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Internal triggers</strong> tell the user what to do next through associations stored in the user's memory. When a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a preexisting routine, it leverages an internal trigger.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Negative emotions frequently serve as internal triggers. The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user's pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company's product or service as the source of relief.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 25px;">Once we're hooked, using these products does not always require an explicit call to action. Instead, they rely upon our automatic responses to feelings that precipitate the desired behavior.</p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">The bottom line</h3>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Users who continuously find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it. Frequent usage creates more opportunities to encourage people to invite their friends, broadcast content, and share through word of mouth.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Hooked users become brand evangelists—megaphones for your company, bringing in new users at little or no cost.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Gamification isn't a "one size fits all" solution. What if we had dynamic rewards based on the user since everyone is driven by something different? Personalized and gamified experiences for every user, backed by decades of science-backed research.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I really think we can become the best product on the market at getting users to complete desired actions by tapping into the physiology of what makes users tick.</p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I got off the 9 hour plane ride and had about a half hour before an extremely important sales call.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I didn't know it at the time but this was the deal that would lead me to sell my company for millions at 24.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Only issue was my laptop was dead and I didn't bring a European adapter.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I'm not kidding when I tell you this. I literally ran up and down the streets of Amsterdam asking anyone who would listen to help.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I was 3 minutes away from the call and on my last resort.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I ended up giving a man at the front desk of a gym my ID, my wallet and passport as collateral to borrow his charger.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I made it on the call only 1 minute late and closed the deal.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">And while I don't recommend giving a random person all of your belongings in a foreign country… the point I'm trying to make is that sometimes you have to create your destiny with what you're given.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">And this lesson started right here at Butler just a few years ago.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I always knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur but at the time, Butler didn't offer a specific class or major that fit my purpose.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I had 3 credit hours remaining at Butler and instead of taking a class I decided that I would use this as an opportunity to learn the ropes of starting a business.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I didn't really know what the business was going to be or if how this would work but as we all know. Life is won by people who say yes and figure it out later. Not those who wait.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">So I sent a cold email to some guy named Nick.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">He responded out of the blue to meet for coffee and eventually decided to sponsor me in starting Zealot as well as knocking out those 3 credits.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Nick and I carved out a path that allowed me to study entrepreneurship in a way that felt authentic to me and I hope can feel the same way for you all.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I can honestly say that getting the chance to study entrepreneurship at Butler changed my life.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Because in just under 24 months, we went from a measly Figma mockup I built in Econ class to just weeks ago selling Zealot and getting featured in Times Square.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">That's really the heart of what I want to share with you today - just because something doesn't exist doesn't mean it's impossible.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Entrepreneurship, at its core, is about building something from nothing.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Don't assume that because the exact role, major, or path doesn't exist that it can't be done.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I'm sure a lot of you are sitting here today dreaming of launching your own business. Wherever, in education, in tech, in the arts, whatever it may be.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">And my advice to you would be don't wait for the perfect opportunity to show up.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The world needs people who are willing to create doors where none exist… people who are willing to run down the streets of Amsterdam with three minutes to spare and just figure it out.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">A lot of people believe that you can only start a business when you're ready. "When you've learned enough" when you have enough resources.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">But the truth is - I wasn't ready either, there's never going to be a perfect time.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The absolute best advice I have and not to rip off Nike is to "just do it".</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">I'll leave you with a quote I think about a lot: "You don't learn to swim by reading about it, you learn by jumping in."</p>

        <h2>What "The Mom" Test Got Wrong</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; opacity: 0.7;">January 2026</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Yeah, I've read it. It's a great book with good intentions.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Disclaimer: these thoughts are primarily about building in B2B.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">One thing it gets wrong is the assumption that people will take an hour or more out of an already exhausting day to go deep into their consciousness and recall all the problems they encounter.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The sad reality is that most people aren't hunting for problems. They're just there to collect a paycheck. If you're reading this, you're not like them.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Most people are doing the least amount of work possible. They follow a process. They're not constantly reflecting on every friction point.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">So you can't expect them to perfectly recall every problem they face. That's too hard of a question.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">And it's the wrong question. Instead, ask: what are you trying to get done?</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">It's your job to find the issues or friction points in the outcomes they're looking for - not theirs.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Start asking a better question to get a better outcome.</p>

        <h2>Entrepreneurship is like an onion</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; opacity: 0.7;">January 2026</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Most startups are selling Tums.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">They see heartburn and think let's fix the burn!</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">But heartburn isn't the problem. Eating garbage is the problem.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Yes, Tums made billions. Something I haven't done yet! Good for them.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">They also solved nothing.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Unless you have an actual medical condition, they built a business on people's refusal to change.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">It's like a fucking game. Go find someone who doesn't have enough awareness to realize what their root problem is, then sell them a band-aid they'll buy forever.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">It works. And investors love it! Recurring revenue on human weakness. Woooohooo!</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">But the part that these companies won't tell us is that they need us to stay broken.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Tums needs you to keep eating fried food so you get heartburn before bed.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Energy drinks need you to stay sleep-deprived.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Hangover cures need you to keep drinking too much.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">News media needs you to stay outraged.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Because they're not in the business of solving problems. They're in the business of managing symptoms. And as a wise man once said, show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">So yeah, you can build that. You can make money. You can raise a round on your "sustainable competitive moat" (aka people's inability to change).</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Or you could actually peel the onion.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Go to the core. Build something that actually fixes the problem, even if it's harder to sell at first. Even if it means your customer doesn't need you anymore after it works.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Most founders won't do this. The outside of the onion is too comfortable. Too easy.</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">But if you're going to build something that actually makes a dent in the world, ask yourself:</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Are you helping people change? Or are you counting on them staying exactly the same?</p>
